Square [Reader SDK] lets developers embed the [Square] checkout flow and accept
in-person payments in custom apps using Square Readers. The SDK supports
authorization, transaction processing, and Reader management.

Use Square's official Flutter plugin for Reader SDK to build in-person payment
solutions on Android and iOS.


## How to use

The Flutter plugin for Reader SDK acts as a wrapper on the native SDKs and is
currently compatible with the following native Reader SDK versions:

  * iOS: 1.3.3 and above
  * Android: 1.3.3 and above

Try the [sample app] to see the plugin in action or follow the instructions in
the [getting started guide] to build a custom solution from scratch.


### Additional documentation

[flutter plugin GitHub repo]:

* [`example`] - Root directory of the Flutter sample app (with walkthrough).


## Build requirements

### Flutter

A version of Flutter greater than 1.12 is required for v2 embedding support. Any application that uses v1 embeddings for android will still be backwards compatible and supported.
  
### Android

* minSdkVersion is API 21 (Lollipop 5.0) or higher.
* Android SDK platform: API 28.
* Android SDK build tools: 28.0.2
* Android Gradle Plugin: 3.0.0 or greater.
* Support library: 26.0.2
* Google Play Services: 16.0.1
* Google APIs Intel x86 Atom_64 System Image

### iOS

* Xcode version: 10.2 or greater.
* iOS Base SDK: 11.1 or greater.
* Deployment target: iOS 11.0 or greater.


## Reader SDK requirements and limitations

* Reader SDK is only available for accounts based in the United States.
  Authorization requests for accounts based outside the United States return an
  error.
* Reader SDK may not be used for unattended terminals. Using Reader SDK to
  implement payment solutions in unattended terminals or kiosks (for example,
  vending machines) is strictly prohibited.
* Reader SDK requires an authorization token from the [Mobile Authorization API]
  to connect Square Readers and accept payments.
* Reader SDK only supports on-screen tipping. Digital receipts and tips can be
  configured in Reader SDK. Tipping on printed receipts is not supported at this
  time.
* Reader SDK cannot issue refunds. Refunds can be issued programmatically using
  the Refunds API or manually in the [Square Dashboard].
* Reader SDK is not supported in the Square sandbox. See [Testing Mobile Apps]
  for testing recommendations.
* Your version of Reader SDK must adhere to the Square SDK update policy. To
  limit risk to developers and their users, Square enforces an
  [update policy for Reader SDK] that requires developers to keep their version
  of Reader SDK current.
